website features
# Navigation bar
i used the responsinve bootstrap navigation bar because it allows for the menu bar to be reduced and expanded easily depending on the screen size been used .
## HOME PAGE
### logo
my website's logo is a chain link that i put ahead of every h2 on eah of three pages <i class="fas fa-link">
 I chose it because the chain symbol emphasises the power of connecting dofferent styles t achieve a healthy goal as i am going to illustrate later.
 Below is how the frst page looks like ,

1.The format is such that i have all the reasons for working out coming first  ,the quotes and social media where the user can click on whichever media link they are most comfortable with to see what we and our members are about come thereafter in sucessive order.
 2.Initially i hade trouble finding text that would be visible against the dark background of the forst picture. So eventually i decided to add  shadow effect with 0.6 opacity to bring out my white text. in my sing up page that i  had code from coced istitutes love running tutorial website, i was able to implement the shadow effect into all my three pages.
 So at the the beginning of every container section from  the top of eah page , i added the class of sign-up, to keep uniformity
 3.I added a hover effect along side each reasons for working outline to entice the user while they slide their mouse across the screen.
 ### quotes section
1.I put in a hover features as well that changes the font color to a red color to entice the casual reader to read the testimonies pf people who have tried and succeded with this typ of excercise.
 2. For smaller screens, I used bootsrap i changed the visibility stting of the two pictures on the quotes ection to n picture but one text on the the small screen  so that the quote is visible on the viewing height of a mobile screen as  in the picture below:

1. This page goes deeper into details of what an outdoor workout routine would entail.
 2. I decided to divide them into 4 color coded(based on difficulty) sections alongside  icons of batteries at different percentage of usage to show how much intensity each program would entail.
 ### UX
 to maximises on space , each of the color coded program has a dropdown list of challenges from bootstrap 5  that encapsulate the time spent on each  work out .

UNORDERED LIST 
 * 15 minutes routine| medium cardio |8 repetitions(quarter battery font awesome icon)
 1. 15 secs pressupps and 15 seconds rest 
 2. 15 secs sitsups and 15 secs rest 
 3. 15 sec squats and 15 secs rest 
 4. 15 seconds burpees and 15 seconds rest 
 5. sprint home or slow jog home
 * 30 minute routine | 8- repetitons(halv battery font awesome icon)
 1. 30 secs pressupps| 20 secods rest | 10 secs active rest(leg raises) 
 2. 30 secs sitsups and 20 secs rest | 10 sec active rest (high knee taps)
 3. 30 sec squats and 20 secs rest   | 10 secs active rest (press ups)
 4. 30 secs burpees and 20 seconds rest |10 secs active rest (jumping  jacks)
 5. slow jog  while taking the long route back home.
 * 1 hour routine | 8-10 repetitions
  1. 30 secs pressupps and 30 secods rest | 30 secs active rest ( slow burpees/jump rope )(three quarters battery font awesome icon)
 2. 30 secs sitsups and 30 secs rest | 30 secs  active rest (slow high kneee taps )
 3. 30 sec squats and 30 secs rest | 30 secs active rest ( slow leg raises )
 4. 30 seconds burpees and 30 seconds rest | 30 secs (slow jumping jacks )
 5. cardio is optional at this point or a brisk walk home 
 
 * Limitless time | intermitent 5 minute intense and 5 min rest workouts to satisfaction/( full battery font awesome icon)
 1. Could better work as a group activity from two  to more people: In this case,variations 
 based on interactions can contribute to a creative work out ideas from others  
 UX. along with th forest green backgroud , i used bootstrap 5 to enhance the user experience with a dropdown button for each level of workout, Using the battery icon from font awesome . i tried to give the website vistors a visual of how much of your batteey will be worked on depending on which workout you choose.
 
 ### responsive page
 the page is also responsive to different screen sozes witht hte help of bootstrap.

 the abpve is a screenshot of my responsive join webpage , The code is inspired by the love running website  from the tutorials that i thought were very effective  in getting one to join.
 The form is responsive and can only be sent of bothtthe first name, second name and email are entered .
