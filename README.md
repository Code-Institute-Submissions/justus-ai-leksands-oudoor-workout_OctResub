# leksands-oudoor-workout
## SALES PITCH
The goal is to stay active outside the traditional methods.
Leksand is a found in the conuntryside in Sweden.It is very well known for its green forests, trails and perfect outdoors hence the name.(I cuurenty live there).
The target will be the whole body for each workout in a playful and results evoking new style called Hiit(Hight Intensity Interval Training) .All these workouts can be done in the comfort of your home if  the weather doesn't allow but better yet outdoors.
Body weight is the primary excercise tool .

## FEATURES
### NAVIGATION BAR
I used the responsive bootstrap navigation bar because it allows for the menu bar to be reduced and expanded easily depending on the screen size being used .
In  smaller screena, I incooperated the hamburger icon that makes the text at the top disappear and is replaced by the three lines as is illuastrated above in the home page image.
### HOME PAGE
#### LOGO
my website's logo is a chain link that i put before of every heading (h2) on each of the three pages <i class="fas fa-link">
I chose it because the chain symbol symbolises strength.In this case, combining different styles to eleveate strength and conditioning  as i am going to illustrate later.
#### REASONS FOR WORKING OUT OUTSIDE
1.The format is such that I have all the reasons for working out coming first ,then quotes and social media in that order.In the social media section, the user can click on whichever media link they are most comfortable with to see what we and our members are about .(The icons don't lead to actual pages but rather the websites the icons represent)
 
 2.Initially I hade trouble finding a shade of text that would be visible against the dark forest background picture. So eventually i decided to add a  shadow effect with 0.6 opacity to bring out my white text. In my sign up page, I  used code similar to that of the code institute's love running tutorial website;specifically the sign up page.I  was able to implement the shadow effect into all my three pages.
 So at the the beginning of every container section from  the top of each page , I added the class of sign-up, to maintain uniformity.
 3.I added a hover effect alongside each reason to work out listed ,for UX to entice the user while they slide their mouse across the screen.

 #### QUOTES
1.I put in a hover feature as well that changes the font color to a red color to entice the casual reader to read the testimonies of people who have tried and succeded with these type of excercises.
 2. For smaller screens, I used bootsrap's responsive feature that altered the  visibility  of the two pictures on the quotes section so that there are no pictured for smaller hand helt devices but  just text.Below is an illustration:

 #### SOCIAL MEDIA
 1.Social media links to
 faceebook, instagram , linkedin,pinterest ,twitter  and youtube.
 2.All media icons are clickable and open in a new page associated with the media icon.
 3.I also included a hover effect to enhance UX.
 
### ABOUT PAGE

1. This page goes deeper into details of what an outdoor workout routine would entail.Again this is regardless of location .With the entrace of the corna virus, alot of emphasis on keeping ones distance has made it such that anywhee you are is as good as you make it.
 2. I decided to divide the routines into 4 color coded(based on difficulty) sections with the help of battery icons at different percentage of usage to visualise how much intensity each program would entail.
 3. These excercises are entirely dependent on body weight and the patience of repetition to  guide the reader to results.
 4. The time that each person has available for working out everyday based on personal preference is for the user to decide and hence choose from the four categories.
5. to maximise on space , each of the color coded program has a dropdown list of challenges styled with the help of bootstrap 5 that shows what each workout should entail.

 The abave is a screenshot of my responsive join webpage. As metioned earlier,the code is inspired by the love running website from the tutorials that i thought were very effective  in getting one to join.
 The form is responsive and can only be entered succecfuly if the first name, second name and email are ALL entered .

Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from the love running website from code institutes instrctionals tutorial, i thought it matched perfeclty whith what my qebsite inteneded to do.
